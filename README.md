# Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Repository

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** algorithm in both sequential and parallel versions. FFT is a fundamental algorithm in digital signal processing, used to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its inverse efficiently.

The repository includes the following implementations:

1. **Sequential FFT**:
   - **Iterative**: A non-recursive implementation in C++.
   - **Recursive**: A divide-and-conquer implementation in C++.

2. **Parallel FFT**:
   - **CUDA Implementation**: A GPU-accelerated iterative FFT for high-performance computation.
   - **Multithreaded C++ Implementation**: A CPU-parallel iterative FFT using modern C++ threading.
